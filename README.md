## Hanguly
+ I created this simple web app for my first daughter.
+ This web application is designed for learning Korean characters, specifically the Jamo system.
+ Jamo refers to the basic building blocks of Korean characters.
+ **Ja (Ja-eum)** represents consonants in the Korean writing system (e.g., b, k, c, and f in English).
+ **Mo (Mo-eum)** represents vowels in the Korean writing system (e.g., a, e, i, o, and u in English).

## User Interface
+ Simply drag and drop Jamo character buttons.
+ A fun and easy way to learn the structure of Korean characters.
